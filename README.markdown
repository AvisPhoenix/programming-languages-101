# Programming Languages - Syntax 101

Welcome to this repository specially created for students of **The Complete GitHub Course for Developers** on Udemy. 

## Practice with this Repository! :)

This repository is where **you can practice and apply everything we learn in the course** such as:

- **Fork:** You can fork this repository and practice making changes and modifications to the files.
- **Issues:** Practice creating issues by proposing to include an example or programming language to the project or if you find a typo or error in the code or README file.
- **Pull Requests:** Create your very own pull requests by adding examples and files for the project. Research the syntax of a programming language and include it in the corresponding file. Then, submit your pull request :smiley:
- **Link Pull Requests to Issues:** Practice including a mention to the pull request on your issues and see how they are automatically connected.
- **Comments and Discussions:** Practice discussing and commenting issues and pull requests and I will be very glad to reply :)
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown:** Practice adding interesting elements to the comments you post on issues and pull requests.

Much more! Feel free to experiment and learn with this repository during the course.

## Guidelines to Contribute

**NOTE:** Please feel free to act according to the section of the course you are currently studying. (example: If you are learning about pull requests, you can practice submitting a pull request without creating an issue until you reach that section of the course)

This repository will contain samples of the main building blocks of programming such as:

- Variables
- Functions
- Classes
- Loops
- Conditionals

and much more!

- Each programming language will have its own folder and each subcategory (example: Functions) has its own file. 
    - Within those files, you can add your examples by first adding a brief comment in the code and then including your example.

```  python

# A Function that returns the smallest of the two arguments
def returnSmallest(a, b):
	if (a > b):
		return b
	else:
		return a
```

### Pull Request

Please add a descriptive message to your commit and pull request.
 
### Issues

If you reached this section of the course, **create an issue before submitting a pull request explaining the example you are going to include**. 

Through this, you will practice the common workflow to contribute to a project: 

1. Create an issue to ask the project owner if he/she approves the changes you are going to work.
2. Submit a pull request.

**NOTE:** Please mention the pull request in the issue as a comment.

### Add Folder and Files

Please feel free to add folders and files if they currently don't exist for the programming language and category you wish to include.

**Thank you very much for reading these instructions and I really look forward to see all your contributions to the project as you dive into the wonders of GitHub.** :star2:
